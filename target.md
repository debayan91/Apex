# APEX – AI-Augmented Autonomous Trading Operating System

## System Vision
APEX is an institutional-grade decision and execution platform that transforms
market data and information streams into controlled, auditable, risk-managed
financial actions.

It acts as an intelligence and control layer between raw markets and capital.
